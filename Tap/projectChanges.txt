Hello 
The Project is linked below 
here is the changelog

e-mailed week1
just the basic first room 

feed back:
the game needs feedback and more stuff

changed and presented week 2
added a room2 and  enemies  that shoot back. 
other sounds and effects in progress

feedback
its sometimes hard to see the enter sign on the first elevator.
victory screen unreachable
player can fall forever
game still lacks explosions and other types of feedback

changed and presented week3
added explosions 
very little sound effects
a way to finish the game
score system
hp bar 
set elevator up so the Enter Sign always shows.

feed back
killing first enemy on the first stage then changing the goal to reaching the end on the 2nd stage causes confusion
the single enemy is easy to defeat in some situations

changed goal to enter elevator.
small BugFix where unneeded text showed up on screen in larger screens
